Notes - 

Innodb behaves differently than mysam. 

  1. Refer to https://www.quora.com/blog/Jordan-Ryan/Web-Dev/How-to-Recover-innoDB-MySQL-files-using-MAMP-on-a-Mac for basic setup.
  
  2. Found errors in a loop (ALTER TABLE tablename DROP tablespace => table doesn't exist) (CREATE TABLE tablename => table already exists). 
    a. Solution is to find if there are any orphaned ibd files without corresponding frm files. 
    b. Delete them and then try dropping tablespace. 
    c. In this case, I deleted and imported sql dump of DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK. 
    
  3. Errors when cattle is not able to find the MAMP mysql and connection refused error. 
    a. killall -9 mysqld 
    b. start server again. Wait till lsof -i tcp:3306 shows the mysql process. Sometimes it takes time (idk why) 
    c. Try logging in with the default username and password. Check phpMyAdmin shows localhost:3306 running under localhost:8888.
    d. Then retry running cattle.
